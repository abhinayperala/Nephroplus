# 🧠 Medical Report OCR to JSON (Hackathon Project)

This project extracts structured medical data from scanned lab report images using **Tesseract OCR** and **rule-based parsing**.  
It is fully **Kaggle-compatible** and produces a final output JSON that matches the format required by the [Alumnx Hackathon](https://forms.gle/5fJwwC4UdGyJnQDFA).
